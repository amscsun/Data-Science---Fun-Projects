# Data-Science---Fun-Projects

This rep includes some fun projects for data science I was working on in my spare time. It's mostly going through open tutorials and solve interesting probklems from publicly open courses.

1. trial of scikit-learn package, especially the classes for more recently developed algorithms including
  a) gaussian processes
  b) gaussian mixtures and gaussian mixtures with Dirichlet priors to determine number of clusters
  c) LDA
  d) spectral clustering and related spectral methods
  
2. solutions to the CS106 data science course offered by harvard.
  Though solutions are available on other sources, going through the problem sets and work on real world problems is still interesting.
  This course has an amazingly small amount of theory and still make you able to using the most applicable methods on real problems with "great" performance. I think this is missing in many statistical and math course.
  
3. solutions to the NLP2(natural language processing) programming problem sets and projects. 
  I haven't got the chance to take the class. So I decided I would read about the materials and try to solve the problems. It turns out to be great way of learning about the theories and putting them into work.
